					"Failover Routing and Latency-based Routing are the only two correct options, as they consider routing data based on whether the resource is healthy or whether one set of resources is more performant than another.  Any answer containing location based routing (Geoproximity and Geolocation) cannot be correct in this case, as these types only consider where the client or resources are located before routing the data.  They do not take into account whether a resource is online or slow.  Simple Routing can also be discounted as it does not take into account the state of the resources."
