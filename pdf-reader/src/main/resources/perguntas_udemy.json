    "description" : "There are a number of ways you can optimise performance above that of choosing the correct EBS type. One of the easiest options is to drive more I/O throughput than you can provision for a single EBS volume, by striping using RAID 0. You can join multiple gp2, io1, st1, or sc1 volumes together in a RAID 0 configuration to use the available bandwidth for these instances. You can also choose an EC2 instance type that supports EBS optimisation. This ensures that network traffic cannot contend with traffic between your instance and your EBS volumes. The final option is to manage your snapshot times, and this only applies to HDD based EBS volumes. When you create a snapshot of a Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) or Cold HDD (sc1) volume, performance may drop as far as the volume's baseline value while the snapshot is in progress. This behaviour is specific to these volume types. Therefore you should ensure that scheduled snapshots are carried at times of low usage. The one option on the list which is entirely incorrect is the option that states \"Never use HDD volumes, always ensure that SSDs are used\" as the question first states \"In addition to choosing the correct EBS volume type for your specific task\". HDDs may well be suitable to certain tasks and therefore they shouldn't be discounted because they may not have the highest specification on paper."

Using Consolidated Billing may ultimately reduce the amount you pay, as you may qualify for Volume Discounts. There is no charge for using Consolidated Billing."

The question also states that the queue, \"must allow for efficient polling\" and in this case long polling is the most efficient and cost effective option in situations where the queue will be polled constantly.
